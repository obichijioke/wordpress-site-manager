## Rollback Plan

If issues are discovered:

### Quick Disable (Frontend Only)

```typescript
// In src/pages/Content.tsx, remove these props:
<ImageSearchModal
  isOpen={showImageSearch}
  onClose={() => setShowImageSearch(false)}
  onSelectImage={handleInsertImage}
  // articleTitle={formData.title}  // Comment out
  // articleContent={formData.content}  // Comment out
/>
```

### Full Rollback

```bash
# Revert to previous commit
git revert HEAD

# Or checkout previous version
git checkout <previous-commit-hash>

# Rebuild and redeploy
npm run build
```

### Partial Rollback (Backend Only)

```typescript
// In api/routes/images.ts, comment out the route:
/*
router.post('/suggest-search-terms', authenticateToken, async (req, res) => {
  // ... entire route
})
*/
```

## Monitoring & Alerts

### Metrics to Track

1. **Usage Metrics**
