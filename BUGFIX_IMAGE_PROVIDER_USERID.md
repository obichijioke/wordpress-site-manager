# 🐛 Bug Fix: Image Provider Save Error

## Problem
Users were getting "Failed to save provider" error when trying to save image provider configurations in the Settings page.

## Root Cause
The authentication middleware (`authenticateToken`) sets `req.user` with properties `{ id, email, name, role }`, but the image routes were trying to access `req.user.userId` instead of `req.user.id`.

### Error Details
```
PrismaClientValidationError: 
Invalid `prisma.imageProvider.upsert()` invocation
Argument `userId` is missing.
create: {
  userId: undefined,  // <-- userId was undefined!
  ...
}
```

## Solution
Fixed all occurrences of `req.user.userId` to `req.user.id` in the image routes.

## Files Changed

### 1. `api/routes/images.ts`
Changed all 6 occurrences:
- Line 14: `const userId = req.user!.id` (search route)
- Line 54: `const userId = req.user!.id` (get providers route)
- Line 70: `const userId = req.user?.id` (save provider route)
- Line 131: `const userId = req.user!.id` (usage stats route)
- Line 147: `const userId = req.user!.id` (log usage route)
- Line 177: `const userId = req.user!.id` (delete provider route)

### 2. `api/services/images/image-service.ts`
- Added validation for `userId` parameter
- Added 'unsplash' to valid providers list
- Line 80: Added `if (!userId || typeof userId !== 'string')` check
- Line 83: Updated `validProviders` to include 'unsplash'

## Testing

### Before Fix
```
❌ Error: "Failed to save provider"
❌ Console: "Argument `userId` is missing"
❌ userId was undefined in database operations
```

### After Fix
```
✅ Provider saves successfully
✅ API key is encrypted and stored
✅ Provider appears in settings
✅ Can search images with the provider
```

## How to Test

1. **Clear browser cache** and refresh the page
2. Go to **Settings** → **Image Providers**
3. Try to save **Openverse** provider (no API key needed):
   - Enable the provider
   - Click "Test Connection" → Should see ✅
   - Click "Save Provider" → Should see success message
4. Try to save **Pexels** provider (requires API key):
   - Get API key from https://www.pexels.com/api/
   - Enter API key
   - Click "Test API Key" → Should see ✅
   - Click "Save Provider" → Should see success message
5. Verify providers are saved:
   - Refresh the page
   - Providers should still be enabled
   - Go to Content → New Post → Search Images
   - Should see results from enabled providers

## Additional Improvements

### Better Error Handling
Added validation in the save provider route:
```typescript
const userId = req.user?.id

if (!userId) {
  console.error('Save provider error: userId is missing from token')
  return res.status(401).json({ error: 'Authentication failed: userId not found' })
}
```

### Better Logging
Added console log to track provider saves:
```typescript
console.log(`Saving provider config: userId=${userId}, provider=${provider}, isEnabled=${isEnabled}`)
```

### Validation in Service Layer
Added userId validation in `saveProviderConfig`:
```typescript
if (!userId || typeof userId !== 'string') {
  throw new Error('Invalid userId')
}
```

## Status
✅ **FIXED** - All image provider save operations now work correctly!

## Related Files
- `api/lib/auth.ts` - Authentication middleware (defines `req.user` structure)
- `api/routes/images.ts` - Image API routes (fixed userId references)
- `api/services/images/image-service.ts` - Image service (added validation)
- `prisma/schema.prisma` - Database schema (ImageProvider model)

## Notes
- This was a simple property name mismatch
- The authentication system uses `id`, not `userId`
- All other routes in the application correctly use `req.user.id`
- The image routes were the only ones with this issue

## Prevention
To prevent similar issues in the future:
1. Always check the `AuthenticatedRequest` interface definition
2. Use TypeScript strict mode to catch undefined properties
3. Add validation for critical parameters like `userId`
4. Test authentication-dependent features thoroughly
