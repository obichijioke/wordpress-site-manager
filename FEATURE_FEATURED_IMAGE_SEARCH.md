### ðŸŽ¨ **Dark Mode Support**

## Implementation Details

### File Modified
**`src/components/FeaturedImageUpload.tsx`**

### Changes Made

#### 1. **New Imports**
```typescript
import { Search } from 'lucide-react'
import ImageSearchModal from './images/ImageSearchModal'
import { ImageResult } from '../lib/image-api'
```

#### 2. **New State Variables**
```typescript
const [showImageSearch, setShowImageSearch] = useState(false)
const [downloadingImage, setDownloadingImage] = useState(false)
```

#### 3. **New Function: `handleSelectImageFromSearch`**
```typescript
const handleSelectImageFromSearch = async (image: ImageResult) => {
  setError('')
  setDownloadingImage(true)

  try {
    // Download the image from the URL
    const response = await fetch(image.url)
    if (!response.ok) {
      throw new Error('Failed to download image')
    }

    const blob = await response.blob()
    
    // Create a File object from the blob
    const filename = `featured-${image.id}.${blob.type.split('/')[1] || 'jpg'}`
    const file = new File([blob], filename, { type: blob.type })

    // Validate and upload the file
    const validationError = validateFile(file)
    if (validationError) {
      setError(validationError)
      return
    }

    await onImageUpload(file)
  } catch (err) {
    setError(err instanceof Error ? err.message : 'Failed to download and upload image')
  } finally {
    setDownloadingImage(false)
  }
}
```

#### 4. **Updated UI Elements**

**Search Button:**
```tsx
<div className="flex items-center justify-between">
  <label className="block text-sm font-medium text-gray-700 dark:text-gray-300">
    Featured Image
  </label>
  <button
    type="button"
    onClick={() => setShowImageSearch(true)}
    disabled={disabled || uploading || downloadingImage}
    className="text-sm text-indigo-600 dark:text-indigo-400 hover:text-indigo-700 dark:hover:text-indigo-300 flex items-center gap-1 transition-colors disabled:opacity-50 disabled:cursor-not-allowed"
  >
    <Search className="w-4 h-4" />
    Search Images
  </button>
</div>
```

**Loading State:**
```tsx
{uploading || downloadingImage ? (
  <>
    <Loader2 className="w-12 h-12 text-indigo-500 animate-spin" />
    <p className="text-sm text-gray-600 dark:text-gray-400 font-medium">
      {downloadingImage ? 'Downloading image...' : 'Uploading image...'}
    </p>
  </>
) : (
  // ... upload UI
)}
```

**Image Search Modal:**
```tsx
<ImageSearchModal
  isOpen={showImageSearch}
  onClose={() => setShowImageSearch(false)}
  onSelectImage={handleSelectImageFromSearch}
/>
```

## How It Works

### User Flow
1. User goes to **Content** â†’ **New Post** or edits existing post
2. In the Featured Image section, clicks **"Search Images"** button
3. Image search modal opens
4. User searches for images (e.g., "mountain landscape")
5. Results from all enabled providers are displayed
6. User selects an image
7. System downloads the image from the provider
8. System validates the downloaded file
9. System uploads the file to WordPress
10. Featured image is set for the post

### Technical Flow
```
User clicks "Search Images"
  â†“
ImageSearchModal opens
  â†“
User searches and selects image
  â†“
handleSelectImageFromSearch() called
  â†“
fetch(image.url) - Download image
  â†“
Convert Blob to File object
  â†“
validateFile() - Check type and size
  â†“
onImageUpload(file) - Upload to WordPress
  â†“
Featured image set successfully
```
